# Chrome Dino Game, but in Kotlin

The famous Chrome Dino Game, adapted for mobile in Kotlin.
## APK in /app/releases/
Of course Android will block it -> click on "Install anyway"

## V1 is out, with basic functionalities : 
- Jump over cacti
- Speed slightly increase over time
- Replay arrow to try again !

> It should scale well with devices size !

## However, it lacks :
- High score save
- Proper UI (on start and death)

> More background art may arrive (someday)
